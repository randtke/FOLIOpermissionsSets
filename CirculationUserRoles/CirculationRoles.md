# Circulation User Roles  

**Background** This describes desired user roles within a circulation department, and then gives the list of FOLIO permissions to support each role.  

## GS:  Circ Desk Student Worker  

**Role**:  Circ Desk Student Worker  

**Description**

Desired permissions:  
* Check items in and out
* View limited patron information (ie. user group and expiration date); cannot view patron address, phone number, and contact info
* Be able to send an email from FOLIO to the patron, and the email is logged on that patron’s record.  Students cannot delete the record of that contact from out of FOLIO.  The email from FOLIO includes a note to reply to our circulation desk email, and the email that goes to the patron cc’s to that circulation desk email.
* Can extend a patron's expiration date
* Create a patron account, including expiration date and user group
* Add notes to items; not able to delete a note
* Add notes to patrons; not able to delete a note
* Can work with requests (ie. hold shelf, etc.):  Be able to print a pull slip, retrieve an item from the shelf, and scan it in to the hold shelf.  (For GIL Express(all students at GS work with GIL Express to the extent of pulling items from the stacks and filling the request:  student workers should be able to print a pull slip, grab the book, scan it in, print the transit letter, and then give it to full-time staff for further processing.)
* Create a GIL Express request on behalf of a patron.
* Create a request/hold on behalf of a patron.  (From Georgia Southern Lane/Henderson or other USG libraries.)
* Specific FOLIO permissions related to viewing settings:  We want these permissive but not distracting:
* When a worker encounters a block, there is a pop up message that gives information about the block and what is causing that block.  (Students should see the block message only, but should not be able to override any blocks.  All other employees should also see the message, and if able to override, then that permission to override is listed separately.)

* Check out: View loans (necessary; needs to include remote loans for GIL Express items that are in another institution’s collection and are checked out to a GS patron)
* Check out: View requests (necessary)
* Inventory: View instances, holdings, and items (necessary to allow students to do special projects)
* Lists (Enable): Can view lists (harmless, unless a list report shows patron contact information, in which case students should not be allowed to view lists and should not have this permission)
